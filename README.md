# FlightControlSystem
This a Embeded Project
# Introduction
Before I post this project,I've made a Quadricopter,which is controlled by APM2.8---a fairly foolproof platform,
you just have to buy some integrated compoments & wiring signal cables correctly,then you can "Go Sky".
So when the motor spun,I didn't feel excited actually.
But now,I've got some stuff,and I'm trying to write a FCS all by myself.
Let's wait and see.

# 简介
在开这个项目之前我弄过一个大四轴，用的飞控是APM2.8，稍有常识的人都能看出，这是个傻瓜式的平台:你只需要买堆零件，把线
给他连对喽，就能上天谈笑风生。
所以当我的电机跑起来以后并没有感到一颗赛艇。
但现在，我可是身经百战，见得多了，西....咳咳，我有能力自己写个飞控玩玩。
废话不多讲，天上不会掉馅饼，大家撸起袖子加油干。
另，续一秒。
此致
            不敬礼
